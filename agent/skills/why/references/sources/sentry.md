# Sentry Error History

## What this source contains

Sentry is the archive of things that went wrong. For defensive, corrective, or error-handling code, it often holds the direct motivation: the specific exceptions, stack traces, and frequencies that pushed someone to add a check, catch, retry, or fallback.

- **Issues.** Grouped errors with counts, first/last seen timestamps, affected releases, and comments
- **Events.** Individual error instances within an issue (stack traces, tags, user context)
- **Releases.** Deployment records with associated issues (useful for "which version fixed this?")
- **Replays.** Session recordings of user-facing errors (if enabled)
- **Profiles.** Performance profiling data (less useful for "why", more for "how slow")
- **Issue comments & assignments.** Sometimes contain engineer notes on root cause

The most valuable thing Sentry provides is **temporal correlation**: "issue X was created 2024-01-02, peaked at 500 events/day, stopped appearing after release v2.14.0 on 2024-01-15, the release that shipped the defensive check."

## How to search it

Use this source only when reachable through an authenticated read-only interface. Discover MCP tools via `tool_search` when available or Pi codemode discovery; CLIs and `web_search`/`fetch_content` are alternatives. Inspect actual schemas or CLI help before invoking anything. If absent or inaccessible, report a coverage gap; the evidence types and pitfalls below still apply.

1. Identify the organization and project through the reachable error-tracking interface.
2. Search issues by exception class, target function/class, error strings, and file paths.
3. Narrow by release and time. Record first/last seen, affected releases, frequency trajectory, environment, tags, and sampling.
4. Read a full representative event. Check whether stack traces, tags, and breadcrumbs match the target's defensive conditions.
5. Inspect releases near the change and cross-reference release versions with the PR merge date.
6. If an AI root-cause analysis is reachable, use it only as a hypothesis generator. Actual events and stack traces remain primary evidence.

## What good evidence looks like here

- An issue whose **first seen** is shortly before the target's PR and **last seen** shortly after, suggesting the target addressed this error
- Stack traces that pass through or land on the target function, showing the exact failure mode being defended against
- A comment on the issue from the PR author describing the fix
- The target's PR description or commit message referencing a Sentry issue URL or ID
- An issue with high event counts that stops after the release containing the target

## Common pitfalls

- **Grouping drift.** Sentry groups errors by fingerprint. Refactors or renames can track the "same" error under a new issue ID. If an issue ends abruptly, the error may have just been regrouped. Check for new issues immediately after.
- **Release correlation is noisy.** A release contains many commits. An issue stopping at v2.14.0 doesn't prove the target fixed it. Another change in the same release might have. Cross-reference with the target's exact commit.
- **Silent fixes.** Sometimes the error stops because upstream changed, not because of the defensive code. The correlation suggests the fix. It doesn't prove authorship.
- **Resolved != fixed.** Issues can be marked "resolved" manually without any code change. Treat `resolved` as a human marker, not evidence that code fixed it.
- **Seer hallucinations.** Seer can generate confident-sounding explanations that aren't right. Fall back to the actual events, stack traces, and timestamps when making claims.
- **Sampling.** Some projects sample events aggressively. A low event count may just mean high sampling, not a rare error. If in doubt, note the gap.

## What to return

For each relevant issue:
- Issue ID and title
- Project and organization
- First seen / last seen timestamps
- Event count (and sampling rate if known)
- Affected releases
- A representative stack trace snippet showing relevance to the target (verbatim excerpt, not summary)
- First/last-seen correlation with the target's ship date
- Link to the issue
- Any author comments or resolution notes
